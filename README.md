Back to Top with Bootstrap icon font

Link to the scripts.js and style.css file, or add them to your current documents. 
You will also need to be linked to bootstrap's icon fonts as the <i class="glyphicon glyphicon-chevron-up"></i> is 
appended to the body via the js file. 

Default opacity of the "back to top" button is .5 which animates to 1 on hover.
